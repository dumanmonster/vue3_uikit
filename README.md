# Vue3 Composition Api UI_Kit

Vue3 Composition API is a new way to write Vue components that allows developers to use reactive data, computed properties, and lifecycle hooks outside of the Vue object. This approach enables developers to organize their code in a more modular and functional way, making it easier to maintain and reuse. A UI kit is a collection of pre-designed components and styles that can be used to build consistent and professional-looking user interfaces. By combining the Vue3 Composition API and a UI kit, developers can create reusable and customizable components with ease.
